2
0:00:06.000 --> 0:00:08.000
if you're asked to design a church or a

3
0:00:08.000 --> 0:00:09.000
temple your first thought probably

4
0:00:09.000 --> 0:00:11.000
wouldn't be to carve one directly into

5
0:00:11.000 --> 0:00:13.000
the ground and make it out of a single

6
0:00:12.000 --> 0:00:14.000
block of rock

7
0:00:14.000 --> 0:00:16.000
the amount of labor required to perform

8
0:00:16.000 --> 0:00:18.000
such a task would be prohibitive in the

9
0:00:18.000 --> 0:00:20.000
extreme nevertheless someone did

10
0:00:20.000 --> 0:00:22.000
precisely that in la la bella in

11
0:00:22.000 --> 0:00:25.000
ethiopia a very long time ago

12
0:00:25.000 --> 0:00:27.000
you won't find any other churches

13
0:00:27.000 --> 0:00:28.000
anywhere else in the world that look

14
0:00:28.000 --> 0:00:31.000
like these raccoon works of beauty

15
0:00:31.000 --> 0:00:33.000
the most famous and impressive of them

16
0:00:33.000 --> 0:00:35.000
is the church of saint george which

17
0:00:35.000 --> 0:00:37.000
archaeologists believe was carved from

18
0:00:37.000 --> 0:00:38.000
the inside out and finished with a

19
0:00:38.000 --> 0:00:41.000
distinctive cross shape at the top there

20
0:00:41.000 --> 0:00:43.000
are 11 raccoon churches in total in la

21
0:00:41.000 --> 0:00:44.000
libella

22
0:00:44.000 --> 0:00:46.000
all of which are connected by secret

24
0:00:46.000 --> 0:00:48.000
tunnels and appear to have been built

25
0:00:48.000 --> 0:00:50.000
between the 12th and 13th centuries

26
0:00:50.000 --> 0:00:52.000
quite how people living hundreds of

27
0:00:52.000 --> 0:00:54.000
years ago managed to create structures

28
0:00:52.000 --> 0:00:56.000
like this working in almost total

29
0:00:56.000 --> 0:00:59.000
darkness is unknown it stands to reason

30
0:00:59.000 --> 0:01:01.000
that they had some form of technology to

31
0:01:01.000 --> 0:01:03.000
help them but we have no idea what that

32
0:01:03.000 --> 0:01:06.000
technology might have been

33
0:01:06.000 --> 0:01:08.000
subscribe for more videos like this and

34
0:01:08.000 --> 0:01:10.000
turn on the notification to help the
